# R Variables and Constants

Welcome to www.codeswithpankaj.com! In this tutorial, we will explore the concepts of variables and constants in R, a powerful programming language used for statistical computing and graphics. Understanding these fundamental concepts is crucial for efficient programming in R.

## What are Variables in R?

Variables are used to store data values in R. They act as containers that hold information which can be manipulated and referenced throughout the program. Variables in R are dynamic, meaning they can hold different types of data at different times.

### Types of Variables

1. **Numeric Variables**
2. **Character Variables**
3. **Logical Variables**
4. **Complex Variables**
5. **Vector Variables**
6. **List Variables**

Let's delve into each type with examples.

### 1. Numeric Variables

Numeric variables store numbers. These can be integers or floating-point numbers.

**Example:**
```R
# Integer
x <- 10
print(x)

# Floating-point
y <- 10.5
print(y)
```

### 2. Character Variables

Character variables store text (strings).

**Example:**
```R
# Single character
name <- "Pankaj"
print(name)

# Multiple characters
greeting <- "Hello, welcome to www.codeswithpankaj.com"
print(greeting)
```

### 3. Logical Variables

Logical variables store Boolean values: `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

**Example:**
```R
# Logical values
is_true <- TRUE
print(is_true)

is_false <- FALSE
print(is_false)
```

### 4. Complex Variables

Complex variables store complex numbers, which have real and imaginary parts.

**Example:**
```R
# Complex number
z <- 2 + 3i
print(z)
```

### 5. Vector Variables

Vectors are sequences of data elements of the same basic type. They are one-dimensional arrays.

**Example:**
```R
# Numeric vector
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(numbers)

# Character vector
words <- c("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(words)
```

### 6. List Variables

Lists can store different types of elements (numbers, strings, vectors) and are used for more complex data structures.

**Example:**
```R
# List with different types of elements
my_list <- list(name = "Pankaj", age = 28, scores = c(85, 90, 95))
print(my_list)
```

## Constants in R

Constants are fixed values that do not change during the execution of a program. In R, constants can be defined using the `const` keyword in some languages, but in R, we typically define constants using variables and avoid modifying them.

### Types of Constants

1. **Numeric Constants**
2. **Character Constants**
3. **Logical Constants**

Let's see examples for each.

### 1. Numeric Constants

Numeric constants can be integers or floating-point numbers.

**Example:**
```R
# Numeric constant
PI <- 3.14159
print(PI)
```

### 2. Character Constants

Character constants are string literals.

**Example:**
```R
# Character constant
URL <- "www.codeswithpankaj.com"
print(URL)
```

### 3. Logical Constants

Logical constants are `TRUE` and `FALSE`.

**Example:**
```R
# Logical constant
IS_ACTIVE <- TRUE
print(IS_ACTIVE)
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored variables and constants in R, understanding their types and how to use them effectively. Mastering these concepts is essential for any R programmer, as they form the backbone of data manipulation and storage in your programs.

Keep practicing and experimenting with different types of variables and constants to deepen your understanding. Happy coding!
